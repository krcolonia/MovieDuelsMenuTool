A small tool I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to help me make menu layouts for my copy of Star Wars: Movie Duels.

I was pretty fed up with manually editing the game files and reloading the game just to see the changes, and seeing as how the menu files in that game are almost the same in design with HTML, I just made this tool to make layouts fast without restarting the game.

might add a feature to generate .menu files out of this, but a layouter is fine for now. just don't reload the page while using it so that you won't lose your menu layouts lmao.
